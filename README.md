# Python Script to use OpenAI Api to create Content

Used the ChatGPT to create this script and it is working.

Model used: text-curie-001

What it do?

1. Ask the CSV file path
2. Ask the column name (case sensitive)
3. Ask the OpenAI Api Key

Then it reads the keyword from the column and produce content.

We can use it to spam the internet with rubbish content. :)
