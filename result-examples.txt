What is sunscreen SPF?

Sunscreen is a topical medication used to prevent skin cancer and other skin diseases. Sunscreen is classified by its SPF (sun protection factor) number. The higher the SPF number, the more effective the sunscreen. Sunscreen with an SPF of 30 blocks 93% of the sun’s UVB radiation, while sunscreen with an SPF of 50 blocks 97% of the sun’s UVB radiation. 

The FDA has set a limit of SPF 30 for sunscreens to be labeled as “broad spectrum”. Sunscreens with an SPF greater than 30 must also contain other ingredients to provide additional protection against UVA and UVB radiation. 

Sunscreen is most effective when used regularly, especially during the summer months. Sunscreen should be applied liberally before sun exposure and re-applied every two hours, even if you are only going to be outside for a short time. Sunscreen should also be used in conjunction with a sun protection factor (SPF) clothing recommendation. 

For more information on sunscreen and its various types and SPF ratings, please visit the FDA’s website.
